            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>This interactive documentary focuses on how people from different cultures view animals and how these views affect the way animals are represented. By exploring animals like black cats, dragons, and weasels through myths, history, and cultural traditions, the project shows how human ideas can give animals both positive and negative meanings. For example, black cats are often linked to bad luck because of superstitions, which has sadly led to them having the lowest adoption rates and highest euthanasia rates in shelters (Trasser, 2024). This example demonstrates how human beliefs can directly impact animal welfare. I chose this topic because I wanted to explore how the meanings we attach to animals are shaped by human stories and how these stories affect animals in the real world. Using a non-linear and branching structure lets viewers explore the stories of each animal individually while also seeing the bigger picture of how cultures and histories connect. Nash (2017) explains that interactive documentaries allow viewers to be more involved, helping them build their understanding of the subject rather than just watching passively. This approach makes the documentary more engaging and reflective, encouraging audiences to think about the bigger themes. The documentary mainly follows the expository mode, bringing together images, videos, and text from different times and places to make an argument about how people shape the meanings of animals (Nicholes & Baron, 2024). At the same time, it includes poetic elements by presenting animals in new ways that encourage viewers to think differently about their familiar symbols (Nicholes & Baron, 2024). Ethical concerns were also important during the project, especially when using media from online sources, as privacy and access can be sensitive issues (Rose, 2017). By respecting these considerations, this documentary aims not only to share information but also to encourage critical thinking about how our cultural beliefs shape our relationships with animals and nature.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>A.	Research Question:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">How do gender biases manifest in AI-generated images of specific professions?</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>B.	Underlying data:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Data from DATAUSA (2022), sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau ACS PUMS 5-Year Estimates, https://datausa.io/</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>C.	Description of the process:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">1) I selected three professions to analyse gender representation in AI-generated images:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preschool Teacher</li>
                <li>Bricklayer</li>
                <li>Bartender</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">2) I used Canva’s AI creation tool to generate images for each profession. For each profession, I used three different prompts (each prompt generated 8 images):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A gender-neutral prompt for the profession</li>
                <li>A prompt emphasizing male representation</li>
                <li>A prompt emphasizing female representation</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">3) I analysed the AI-generated images to determine gender representation for each profession. I then compared these results against real-world data from DATAUSA (2022), which provides the gender breakdown for these professions in the U.S.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Text Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Initial Prompt:</p>
            <p class="content">You are the marketing team of a university in the UK whose job it is to promote a new undergraduate degree programme in Digital Cultures, produce a text for this promotional activities, it should describe the focus of the new programme, the materials taught and explain what kind of prospective student it’s aimed at.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Revised Prompt:</p>
            <p class="content">Provide alumni success stories (e.g., career paths), emphasize diversity and inclusion, how teacher expertise can help students, add some examples, such as any app or something else that students can learn from this new undergraduate degree programme in Digital Cultures.</p>
        
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Image Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Initial Prompt:</p>
            <p class="content">The university classroom is filled with different students participating in digital culture lessons that represent different aspects of digital culture.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Revised Prompts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First Image: The university's diverse and inclusive classroom environment is filled with students from different cultural backgrounds. The students are in the middle of a digital culture class. The teacher is standing at the front, enthusiastically explaining concepts and colorful images related to social media/game design in front of a large projection screen, while some students are taking notes, others are discussing in pairs, and others are presenting a variety of digital media on their laptops.</p></li>
                <li>Second Image: A promotional image for the subject of digital cultures and media with video game design, social media software, and web design, colorful image.</p></li>
                <li>Third Image: A few digital culture program students of different races and genders are smiling at the camera.</p></li>
            </ul>
        
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Audio Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Using elevenlabs.io, I generated AI voice. I used various tone options to adjust the pitch to ensure the audio sounded more engaging.</p>
        
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Transcript Generation</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Using Gemini, I generated the text, and based on this text, I created the transcript. I added prompts related to tone adjustments (e.g., more lively) to improve the output.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>In making this session, the most time-consuming aspect was generating AI image content. Although the initial prompt was "different students", the outcome predominantly featured male Caucasian individuals. Therefore, I supplemented the prompt with "different cultural backgrounds" to ensure a more diverse representation. This adjustment aligns with Gillespie's (2014) concept of "algorithmic discrimination", where algorithms may inadvertently reinforce existing biases. The limitations of the image generation tool highlight the current immaturity of AI in accurately depicting facial features and diversity, often resulting in distorted facial representations. Furthermore, the AI-generated content exhibited varying degrees of success and limitations across different modalities. While text generation efficiently crafted a message emphasizing the program's inclusivity and appeal to diverse audiences, the image generation tool struggled to accurately represent diversity, resulting in images that predominantly featured male Caucasian individuals. Despite its limitations, the image generation tool's ability to produce visuals based on textual prompts could be beneficial for individuals lacking artistic skills. However, it raises concerns biases, and copyright infringement. Conversely, the audio generation tool performed admirably, producing natural-sounding voice recordings that effectively conveyed the promotional message. The AI-generated voice closely resembled that of a human speaker, showcasing the advancement of audio generation technology. Nevertheless, the sophistication of audio generation technology also presents risks, as it could be exploited for fraudulent purposes or to manipulate individuals. Overall, while AI tools offer valuable assistance in content creation, they are not without limitations. The discrepancies in representation across different modalities underscore the need for human oversight and intervention to ensure inclusivity and mitigate algorithmic biases. Furthermore, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI Development (2018) emphasizes fairness, accountability, and transparency as core principles. The session could benefit from referencing these principles in relation to AI content creation, the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI-generated content necessitate ongoing research and discussion on AI and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).</p>
