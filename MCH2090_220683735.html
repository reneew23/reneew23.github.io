            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Critical commentary: </strong>This interactive documentary focuses on how people from different cultures view animals and how these views affect the way animals are represented. By exploring animals like black cats, dragons, and weasels through myths, history, and cultural traditions, the project shows how human ideas can give animals both positive and negative meanings. For example, black cats are often linked to bad luck because of superstitions, which has sadly led to them having the lowest adoption rates and highest euthanasia rates in shelters (Trasser, 2024). This example demonstrates how human beliefs can directly impact animal welfare. I chose this topic because I wanted to explore how the meanings we attach to animals are shaped by human stories and how these stories affect animals in the real world. Using a non-linear and branching structure lets viewers explore the stories of each animal individually while also seeing the bigger picture of how cultures and histories connect. Nash (2017) explains that interactive documentaries allow viewers to be more involved, helping them build their understanding of the subject rather than just watching passively. This approach makes the documentary more engaging and reflective, encouraging audiences to think about the bigger themes. The documentary mainly follows the expository mode, bringing together images, videos, and text from different times and places to make an argument about how people shape the meanings of animals (Nicholes & Baron, 2024). At the same time, it includes poetic elements by presenting animals in new ways that encourage viewers to think differently about their familiar symbols (Nicholes & Baron, 2024). Ethical concerns were also important during the project, especially when using media from online sources, as privacy and access can be sensitive issues (Rose, 2017). By respecting these considerations, this documentary aims not only to share information but also to encourage critical thinking about how our cultural beliefs shape our relationships with animals and nature.</p>

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>A.	Research Question:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">How do gender biases manifest in AI-generated images of specific professions?</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>B.	Underlying data:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Data from DATAUSA (2022), sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau ACS PUMS 5-Year Estimates, https://datausa.io/</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>C.	Description of the process:</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">1) I selected three professions to analyse gender representation in AI-generated images:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preschool Teacher</li>
                <li>Bricklayer</li>
                <li>Bartender</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">2) I used Canva’s AI creation tool to generate images for each profession. For each profession, I used three different prompts (each prompt generated 8 images):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A gender-neutral prompt for the profession</li>
                <li>A prompt emphasizing male representation</li>
                <li>A prompt emphasizing female representation</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">3) I analysed the AI-generated images to determine gender representation for each profession. I then compared these results against real-world data from DATAUSA (2022), which provides the gender breakdown for these professions in the U.S.</p>
